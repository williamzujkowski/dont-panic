## Project Plan: dont-panic Repository

This section outlines the specific plan and implementation checklist for the dont-panic repository (the frontend), part of the larger Automated Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (AVIP). This version specifies Astro.js as the frontend framework.

**Reference:** This plan is derived from the main AVIP Project Plan and should be implemented following all standards outlined in CLAUDE.md.

### 1. Vision & Goals (Context)

*   **Overall Vision:** Create an automated platform to monitor vulnerabilities, identify high-priority threats (CVSS >= 9.0, EPSS >= 70%, zero-days), generate LLM-based intelligence reports, and publish them.
*   **This Repository's Role:** To provide a simple, clean, performant, and user-facing web interface using Astro.js that displays the Markdown intelligence reports generated by the vulnerability-intelligence-generator repository. The site itself will be called "Don't Panic".

### 2. Core Principles

*   **Simplicity & Performance:** Focus on effectively displaying the generated Markdown content using Astro's content-first approach. Avoid unnecessary client-side JavaScript.
*   **Automation:** CI/CD pipeline builds and deploys the Astro site whenever new reports are available or code changes.
*   **Readability:** Ensure reports are presented clearly and are easy to navigate.
*   **Standards-Driven:** Adhere to relevant CLAUDE.md standards (e.g., accessibility, testing, Git practices) and Astro best practices.
*   **Decoupling:** Consume reports from a defined source (e.g., synced directory, cloud storage) without tight coupling to the generator's internals.

### 3. Architecture & Workflow

    subgraph vulnerability-intelligence-generator [Repo 2: Intelligence Generator]
        ReportOutput[(Markdown Reports)]
    end

    subgraph dont-panic [Repo 3: Frontend (Astro)]
        direction LR
        ReportFetcher(Fetch/Sync Reports) --> BuildProcess(Astro Build Process)
        BuildProcess --> Display(Static Site Display)
    end

    ReportOutput --> ReportFetcher

    %% Styling (Conceptual)
    classDef repo fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class vulnerability-intelligence-generator,dont-panic repo;
```

*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Report Syncing/Fetching (CI/CD or Trigger):** Markdown reports generated by Repo 2 are copied/synced into the `src/content/reports/` directory (or similar configured content collection) within this repository's source structure.
    2.  **Site Build (CI/CD):** A CI/CD job runs the `astro build` command, which processes the Markdown files (using Astro's content collections) and `.astro` components/layouts into static HTML, CSS, and minimal JS pages.
    3.  **Deployment (CI/CD):** The built static files (typically in the `dist/` directory) are deployed to a hosting provider suitable for static sites.

### 4. Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Astro.js
*   **UI Components:** Astro Components
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (using `@tailwindcss/vite`)
*   **Package Manager:** npm (or pnpm/yarn)
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
*   **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (or Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, etc.)

### 5. Phased Development (This Repo)

*   **Phase 1 (Implemented):** Initialize Astro project with Tailwind. Setup basic project structure (`src/content/reports`, basic layout, report page). Create basic layout/template (`src/layouts/`, `src/pages/reports/[slug].astro`) to display a single Markdown report from `src/content/`. Setup manual report copying. Setup basic CI/CD for building/testing.
*   **Phase 2 (Implemented):** Implement index page (`src/pages/index.astro`) listing all available reports using Astro's content collections API. Refine styling and layout using Tailwind (created `ReportCard` component). Setup deployment CI/CD (using existing `deploy.yml`). *Note: Automated report syncing deferred.*
*   **Phase 3:** Add features like client-side search (e.g., using Pagefind or Algolia integration), filtering/sorting reports, improve accessibility, enhance styling further. Implement automated report syncing/fetching in CI/CD.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `pnpm install` / `yarn install`)
3.  Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:4321` (or the port specified in the console).

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing.

- Run all tests: `npm run test`
- Run tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
