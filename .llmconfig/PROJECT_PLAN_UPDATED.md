# Project Plan: dont-panic Repository - Implementation Status Update

This document outlines the current implementation status and remaining work for the dont-panic repository (the frontend), part of the larger Automated Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (AVIP).

## 1. Current Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Basic Setup & Single Report Display ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Repository initialized with proper structure
- ✅ Astro project with Tailwind CSS configured
- ✅ Basic layouts and components created
- ✅ Content collection schema defined for vulnerability reports
- ✅ Dynamic report page implemented (`[slug].astro`)
- ✅ Sample report added
- ✅ Base styling with Tailwind implemented
- ✅ CI/CD for building/testing configured

### Phase 2: Report Listing & Automated Features ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED
- ✅ Index page listing all reports implemented
- ✅ UI components fully styled and functional:
  - Header, Footer, Hero, Features, ReportCard, etc.
- ✅ Responsive design implemented
- ✅ CI/CD deployment workflow configured for GitHub Pages
- ❌ Automated report syncing not yet implemented

### Phase 3: Enhancements ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Search functionality fully implemented
  - Pagefind integration added for client-side search
  - Search component updated and integrated in the Header
  - Documentation created for search functionality
- ❌ Report filtering/sorting not implemented
- ❌ Advanced accessibility features need review
- ✅ Enhanced styling completed

## 2. Implementation Priorities

### High Priority (Must Complete)
1. ✅ **Search Integration** (COMPLETED):
   - ✅ Installed Pagefind package
   - ✅ Implemented Pagefind integration in `astro.config.mjs`
   - ✅ Updated Search component and integrated in Header
   - ✅ Created documentation for search functionality

2. **Report Filtering/Sorting**:
   - Add filtering by severity (CVSS score ranges)
   - Add sorting options (date, severity)
   - Implement UI controls on the index page

3. **Automated Report Syncing**:
   - Implement workflow for automatically fetching reports from vulnerability-intelligence-generator
   - Configure CI/CD to update site when new reports are available

### Medium Priority (Should Complete)
1. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Conduct accessibility audit (WCAG compliance)
   - Fix any identified issues
   - Add keyboard navigation improvements
   - Ensure proper ARIA attributes

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update README with latest features
   - Document search and filtering usage
   - Update FILE_TREE.md to reflect current structure

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Conduct Lighthouse audit
   - Implement image optimization
   - Further optimize CSS/JS bundles

2. **Enhanced Report Visualization**:
   - Add visual charts for CVSS components
   - Implement timeline visualization for vulnerability lifecycle
   - Add related vulnerabilities section

## 3. Specific Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Complete Search Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Install Pagefind package (installed `pagefind` directly)
- [x] Update `astro.config.mjs` to include Pagefind integration
- [x] Update Search component and integrate in Header
- [x] Create documentation explaining search functionality
- [x] Test search functionality on built site

### Task 2: Implement Filtering and Sorting
- [ ] Create a FilterControls component with:
  - Severity filter (dropdown or radio buttons)
  - Date range filter
  - Sort controls (newest, highest severity)
- [ ] Implement client-side filtering logic
- [ ] Add URL parameter support for sharing filtered views
- [ ] Style the filter controls to match site design

### Task 3: Automated Report Syncing
- [ ] Define report sync strategy:
  - GitHub action to pull from another repository
  - Scheduled job to fetch from an API
  - Manual trigger for report updates
- [ ] Create/update GitHub workflow file
- [ ] Test the sync process on a development branch
- [ ] Document the sync process for maintainers

### Task 4: Accessibility Improvements
- [ ] Run accessibility audit using axe or similar tool
- [ ] Fix any contrast issues in UI
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Add skip-to-content link
- [ ] Test with screen readers

### Task 5: Documentation and Code Quality
- [ ] Update README with latest features
- [ ] Add search and filtering usage documentation
- [ ] Validate that tests pass for all components
- [ ] Update FILE_TREE.md with current structure

## 4. Conclusion

The dont-panic project has a solid foundation with most core functionality implemented. The focus now should be on completing the search integration, implementing filtering/sorting capabilities, and setting up automated report syncing. These enhancements will significantly improve the user experience and fulfill the project's vision as an automated vulnerability intelligence platform frontend.
