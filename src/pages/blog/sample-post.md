# My First Awesome Blog Post

Welcome to the first post on this awesome new blog! This post is written in **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance with a unique frontend architecture. It allows you to build websites with your favorite UI components (React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit) and renders them to static HTML at build time.

- **Performance**: Astro sites load fast because they ship zero JavaScript by default.
- **Developer Experience**: Use familiar tools and languages.
- **Flexibility**: Integrate with various CMS, APIs, and frameworks.

## Getting Started

To add more posts, simply create new `.md` or `.astro` files in the `src/pages/blog/` directory. Make sure to include the necessary frontmatter like `title`, `pubDate`, and `description`.

```javascript
// Example code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
